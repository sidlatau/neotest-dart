# neotest-dart

This plugin provides a [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) tests adapter for the [Neotest](https://github.com/rcarriga/neotest) framework.

## Installation

Using packer:

```lua
use({
  'nvim-neotest/neotest',
  requires = {
    ...,
    'sidlatau/neotest-dart',
  }
  config = function()
    require('neotest').setup({
      ...,
      adapters = {
        require('neotest-dart') {
             command = 'flutter', -- Command being used to run tests. Defaults to `flutter`
                                  -- Change it to `fvm flutter` if using FVM
                                  -- change it to `dart` for Dart only tests
             use_lsp = true      -- When set Flutter outline information is used when constructing test name.
          },
      }
    })
  end
})
```

## Usage

For usage of `Neotest` plugin please refer to [Neotest usage section](https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest#usage)

When `use_lsp` is set, plugin attaches to `dartls` server and listens for outline changes. LSP outline handles more complex test names. Example of the test, that does not work with TreeSitter, but works when `use_lsp` setting is enabled:

```dart
  testWidgets('a' 'b', (tester) async {
    expect(true, false);
  });
```
